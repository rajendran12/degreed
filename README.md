Cypress GitHub API Testing Project
This project demonstrates how to use Cypress for testing the GitHub API. It includes tests for verifying GitHub’s public endpoints, such as fetching user repositories, and mocking responses to simulate various scenarios. The setup uses best practices for securely handling sensitive data and integrates a customizable Cypress testing environment.

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed (v12 or higher recommended).
Cypress: Install Cypress via npm.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cypress-github-api-testing.git
cd cypress-github-api-testing
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root to securely store API keys and tokens:
plaintext
Copy code
GITHUB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Add .env to .gitignore to avoid committing sensitive data.
Configuration
Cypress Configuration
Configure environment variables in cypress.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
// cypress.config.js
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

module.exports = {
  env: {
    apiKey: process.env.GITHUB_API_KEY,
  },
};
Mocking API Responses
We use cy.intercept() to mock network responses and simulate success and error scenarios for GitHub’s public API endpoints. Mocking makes tests more reliable by avoiding dependencies on live API responses.

Running Tests
Run Tests in Headless Mode

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
Run Tests with Cypress Test Runner

bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
Folder Structure
cypress/integration: Contains all test files.
cypress/support: Holds reusable functions and page objects for structured, reusable code.
cypress/fixtures: Stores JSON mock data for simulating API responses.
Test Scenarios
The tests include:

Fetch Repositories for a User: Validates that repositories are fetched and displayed correctly.
Mocked Success Response: Mocks a successful response to simulate expected data.
Error Scenarios: Simulates and validates behavior for API errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error).
Environment Variables
Secure Handling: Store sensitive data, like API keys, in environment variables (.env file) rather than hardcoding them.
CI/CD Integration: Add sensitive data securely in CI/CD environments, such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins, using each platform’s secret management tools.
Generating Reports
Use Mochawesome to generate test reports:

Install Mochawesome

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator
Configure Cypress to Use Mochawesome Update cypress.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: 'mochawesome',
  reporterOptions: {
    reportDir: 'cypress/reports',
    overwrite: false,
    html: false,
    json: true,
  },
});
Run Tests and Generate Report

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run
View HTML Report

bash
Copy code
npx mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/*.json > cypress/reports/combined-report.json
npx mochawesome-report-generator cypress/reports/combined-report.json
